Cloud service providers face a growing challenge: how to effectively audit
increasingly complex AI workloads while protecting customer privacy. As AI
systems become more sophisticated, traditional manual review processes struggle
to scale. The solution lies in extending existing hardware security
infrastructure to enable automated, privacy-preserving verification of compute
workloads.

## **The Challenge of Scaling Trust**

Modern cloud providers need to ensure their infrastructure isn't used for
harmful purposes, whether intentional or accidental. This requires understanding
how customers use compute resources and what kinds of workloads they're running.
However, customers are understandably reluctant to share sensitive details about
their algorithms, data, and compute allocation.

This creates a fundamental tension:

- Providers need sufficient visibility to prevent misuse
- Customers need to protect their intellectual property and maintain competitive
  advantages
- Both sides want efficient, scalable processes

Traditional approaches involving manual review and documentation are becoming
unsustainable as AI workloads grow in complexity and scale. We need automated
solutions that can verify compliance while preserving privacy.

## **Building on Existing Infrastructure**

The good news is that we already have much of the foundational infrastructure
needed. Modern hardware security features like secure enclaves, remote
attestation, and confidential computing provide proven building blocks for trust
and verification.

By extending these existing capabilities, we can create:

- Privacy-preserving compute auditing protocols
- Automated pre-deployment verification
- Scalable trust mechanisms that work with existing hardware

This approach offers several key advantages:

- Leverages battle-tested security infrastructure
- Minimizes disruption to existing workflows
- Provides immediate practical benefits
- Creates foundation for future safety capabilities

## **From Verification to Safety**

While solving the immediate challenge of scalable auditing, this infrastructure
extension also enables broader capabilities for safe AI development. The same
mechanisms that allow privacy-preserving verification of compute workloads can
support:

- Automated compliance checking
- Standardized safety evaluations
- Flexible governance mechanisms
- Multi-stakeholder trust protocols

## **The Path Forward**

Implementing these extensions requires coordination across the hardware security
ecosystem:

- Standards bodies defining interfaces and protocols
- Hardware vendors implementing security features
- Cloud providers deploying verification systems
- AI developers integrating with safety mechanisms

We're actively working with partners across this ecosystem to:

1. Extend existing standards for compute verification
2. Develop privacy-preserving audit protocols
3. Create reference implementations
4. Build practical deployment paths

## **Get Involved**

This effort needs expertise across multiple domains:

- Hardware security architecture
- Standards development
- Machine learning verification
- Policy and governance frameworks

If you're interested in contributing to this work, we'd love to hear from you,
whether you're:

- A hardware security expert
- An AI safety researcher
- A standards body participant
- A cloud infrastructure provider

Together, we can build the infrastructure needed for safe and scalable AI
development.
